PSDCLS: parallel simultaneous diffusion-confusion image cryptosystem based on Latin square 
Abstract: Today, due to the unparalleled growth of multimedia data sharing, especially digital images, between users over insecure channels in real-time applications, cryptography algorithms have gained increasing attention for the secure and efficient ‎transmission.‎ ‎In classical chaos-‎based image ‎cryptosystems, ‎the confusion ‎and ‎diffusion ‎operations ‎are‎ often applied as two separate and independent phases, which threatens the cryptosystem security. ‎T‎‎o address these ‎problems,‎ i‎n this paper, a fast image cryptosystem based on parallel simultaneous diffusion-confusion strategy has been proposed using Latin squares, called PSDCLS. It consists of three main steps. First, the initial parameters of the Hénon-Sine chaotic map are produced from SHA256 of both the plain image content and the user’s secret key. Second, a chaos-based random Latin square is constructed by employing ‎the ‎chaotic sequence produced through the Hénon-Sine chaotic map. Third, a parallel simultaneous diffusion-confusion scheme ‎is‎ proposed by using Latin square and vectorization technique to overcome the problems of ‎computational‎ ‎complexity‎ and high risk of separable and iterative confusion-diffusion operations in the classical chaos-based image cryptosystems. To analyze and evaluate the security and performance of PSDCLS cryptosystem, we conducted extensive simulations and experiments on various benchmark images. ‎‎Experimental results and analyses show that PSDCLS achieves excellent scores for information entropy ‎(‎‎‎>7.99‎‎‎)‎‎, correlation coefficients close to 0, key space ‎(‎‎2^‎{‎512}‎‎‎)‎‎, NPCR ‎(‎‎>99.60%‎‎‎)‎‎, UACI ‎(‎‎‎‎>33.46‎‎%‎‎‎). ‎T‎he encryption time for test images of ‎size 512 * 512 ‎‎and 512 * 512 * 3 ‎was ‎around‎‎‎ 0.026 and ‎0.0‎8‎1‎ ‎seconds,respectively‎. ‎Therefore‎, PSDCLS is highly robust  against common cryptographic attacks and ‎it ‎is ‎a swift cryptosystem for real-time ‎applications‎.
